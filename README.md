**Starting with a cloud server and switch I added a firewall conecting to 2 switches so i can segment the network after i added a desktop workspace i used the CLI tool to set up the ports and configure the lan segments so i could use the firewall GUI on the workstation to finish the setup**

**Once i had a network started I added an active directory server along with user and administrator accounts using the server manager tool, after creating the users I converted it into a domain so i can have the workstation and any of the follwoing servers use a login from the accounts on the AD server**

**To add more functionality I added a Internet Information Services server and added it to the domain so it can handle internet traffic routing**
